If you want to control CSS animations to only run the first time or when the website is still loading on a new window after a refresh, you can use JavaScript to add or remove a class that triggers the animation based on your desired conditions. Here's a basic example of how you can achieve this:

1. Create your CSS animation using `@keyframes` as you normally would:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in-out;
  animation-play-state: running;
}
```

In this example, we have a CSS animation called `fadeIn` that fades an element in.

2. In your `App.js` (or wherever your main component is), add logic to determine whether the animation should be applied initially or when the website is still loading. You can use a state variable and the `localStorage` API for this purpose.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the website is still loading (e.g., by checking a flag in localStorage)
    const isWebsiteLoading = localStorage.getItem('isWebsiteLoading');

    if (isWebsiteLoading === 'true') {
      // If it's still loading, add the class to trigger the animation
      setIsLoading(true);

      // After the animation, set the flag to indicate it's not loading anymore
      setTimeout(() => {
        setIsLoading(false);
        localStorage.setItem('isWebsiteLoading', 'false');
      }, 2000); // 2 seconds (adjust as needed)
    } else {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className={`content ${isLoading ? 'fade-in' : ''}`}>
      {/* Your website content */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this code:

- We initialize the `isLoading` state to `true`.
- In the `useEffect`, we check if the website is still loading by inspecting a flag in `localStorage`. If it's set to `'true'`, we add the `fade-in` class to trigger the animation. After the animation duration (2 seconds in this example), we set the flag to `'false'`.
- If the flag is `'false'`, we do not apply the animation, indicating that the website has already loaded.

3. When you load the website for the first time or after a refresh, set the `localStorage` flag to `'true'` to indicate that the website is still loading. This can be done in your entry point script or wherever you initialize your app:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('isWebsiteLoading', 'true');
```

This approach allows you to control the animation based on whether the website is still loading or not, and it will only trigger the animation the first time or after a refresh.
